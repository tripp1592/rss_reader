uv sync
```

### Required Dependencies

The application requires the following packages:
- `feedparser` - RSS feed parsing
- `pygame` - Audio playback functionality
- `requests` - HTTP requests for feed fetching
- `tkinter` - GUI framework (usually included with Python)

## Usage

### Running the Application

```bash
# Run the main application
uv run main.py
```

### Basic Usage

1. **Add RSS Feeds**
   - Click "Save" to add a new feed
   - Enter the RSS URL and give it a name
   - Select from saved feeds using the dropdown

2. **Browse Episodes**
   - Select a feed and click "Fetch" to load episodes
   - Episodes are displayed in the left panel
   - Audio-enabled episodes show duration when available

3. **Play Audio**
   - Click on an episode to select it
   - Use the audio controls on the right panel
   - Adjust volume with the slider
   - Play/Pause/Stop controls available

### Premium Podcast Support

The app supports premium podcast feeds with authentication:

```
# Examples of supported premium RSS formats
https://feeds.example.com/premium?token=your_token
https://api.example.com/rss?key=your_api_key
```

## Configuration

### Default Feeds

The application comes with a default podcast feed (Modern Wisdom). You can:
- Add more feeds using the "Save" button
- Remove feeds by editing the `feeds.json` file
- Organize feeds by category (manual editing)

### Settings File

Configuration is stored in `feeds.json`:
```json
[
  "https://feeds.simplecast.com/tOjNXDuO",
  "https://your-premium-feed.com/rss?token=abc123"
]
```

## Architecture

The application follows a clean, modular architecture:

```
rss_reader/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py                 # Entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py        # Package initialization
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ gui.py             # GUI components and main application
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ feeds.py           # RSS feed management and parsing
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ audio_player.py    # Audio playback functionality
â”œâ”€â”€ feeds.json             # Saved RSS feeds
â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml         # Project dependencies
â””â”€â”€ README.md              # This file
```

### Module Responsibilities

- **`main.py`** - Simple entry point that launches the GUI
- **`src/gui.py`** - Main GUI class with tkinter interface and event handling
- **`src/feeds.py`** - RSS feed operations (parsing, saving, loading)
- **`src/audio_player.py`** - Audio playback using pygame mixer

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run type checking
uv run -m mypy src/

# Run code formatting
uv run -m black src/

# Run linting
uv run -m flake8 src/
```

### Project Structure

The project follows Python best practices:
- **Type hints** throughout the codebase
- **Error handling** for network and audio operations
- **Modular design** with separation of concerns
- **Documentation** with docstrings for all functions

### Adding New Features

To extend the application:

1. **New audio formats** - Add support in `audio_player.py`
2. **UI improvements** - Modify the GUI in `gui.py`
3. **Feed processing** - Extend functionality in `feeds.py`
4. **Configuration** - Add settings management
